You can see a list of every available service with the next command:

[source,bash]
----
$ cf marketplace
----

Let's create a MySQL database-as-a-service for our Grails application.

NOTE: cleardb is database-as-a-service for MySQL-powered apps

[source,bash]
----
$ cf create-service cleardb spark grailsguidesmysql
Creating service instance grailsguidesmysql in org guides-grails-org / space development as john@email.com...
OK
----

In production we are going to use the MySQL service which we just created.

Let's create a production configuration file:

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application-production.groovy[indent=0]
----

Remove from `application.yml` the environment production datasource block. We define production datasource configuration in `application-production.groovy`

That it is to say:

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0,lines="91..107"]
----

Add MySQL as a runtime dependency to Gradle dependencies block.

[source,groovy]
./build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=54]
----
